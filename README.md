The dataset includes the following features:

- Airline: The name of the airline company. (Categorical feature with 6 different airlines)

- Flight: Flight code information. (Categorical feature)

- Source City: City from which the flight takes off. (Categorical feature with 6 unique cities)

- Departure Time: Time period when the flight departs, grouped into bins. (Categorical feature with 6 unique time labels)

- Stops: Number of stops between the source and destination cities. (Categorical feature with 3 distinct values)

- Arrival Time: Time period when the flight arrives, grouped into bins. (Categorical feature with 6 unique time labels)

- Destination City: City where the flight lands. (Categorical feature with 6 unique cities)
